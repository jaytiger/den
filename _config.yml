# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  현업에서 데이터 엔지니어링과 분석 업무를 수행하며 맞닥뜨린 문제들을 해결해 나가는 과정에서의
  경험과 지식을 기록으로 남기기 위한 페이지들입니다.
  대부분은 GCP상에서의 BigQuery를 중심으로 한 데이터 엔지니어링 관련 내용들이며, 데이터 분석 및 과학과 관련한 내용도 같이 포함하고 있습니다.
  These are pages that record my experience and knowledge that I've faced as a data engineer at work.
  Most of them are related to data engineering tasks using BigQuery on GCP(Google Clouud Platform) and some of data analysis and science topics are also addressed along with them.
